# grgrlib
Library of standard functions serving several processes. Yet undocumented but straigtforward. Contains the functions and classes for solving, filtering and estimating DSGE models @ZLB.

Installation with pip:

Clone the repository and then from within the cloned folder run.
```
pip3 install .
```

The toolbox is in alpha state. Operational, but (yet) not ready for public use and I can not provide any support. You are however very welcome to send me a message if you are interested working with the package.

The beta stage will involve considerable restructuration of packages, code, and the API.
