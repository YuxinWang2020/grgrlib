# grgrlib
Library of standard functions serving several processes. Yet undocumented but straigtforward. Contains the functions for solving DSGE models @ZLB.

For now only the solution method is implemented.

Installation with pip:
```
pip3 install .
```
from the cloned git folder.

The toolbox is in alpha state. Operational, but (yet) not ready for public use and I am not ready to provide any support. However, please feel free to send me a message if you are interested working with it.
